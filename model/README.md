# Model (this is the NLP stuff)
The model is where data becomes useful information. This would normally talk to a database too but we're probably not doing one? Unclear so far. This is where we're gonna put all the NLP stuff like language models!
Try to keep it organized and use the [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) to keep things readable.
